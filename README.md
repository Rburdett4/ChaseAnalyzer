# Chase Checking Account Spending Analyzer

I wanted a drilled-down summary of my spending with Chase; however, it doesn't seem to support that if you aren't a business user. So, I'm opting to make my own!  
  
**Current Version:** < 1.0
  

## Compatibility

This project is being created on a Unix system, and is designed primarily for *NIX system use. However, it should be able to work on any platform, as it takes a single CSV downloadable from Chase Bank for analysis.

## Plans

The plan for this project is quite large (for me). Below is the list of features I wish to have that have not been implemented in the first version:  

* GUI Interface with file searching
* Graphs/Charts for visual drilldown
* Instant download of Chase info
* Routine CRON processing of data at settable intervals
* Date selection within GUI for time frame 
* Much more!


### Prerequisites

None that I know of so far!

### Installing


```
-> Clone this repo
-> Make .py file executable (chmod u+x *.py on bash systems)
-> Ensure the .csv file is within the directory- Future support may include file searching and GUI interface.
```
